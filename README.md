# React Tables and Grids

Accessible table and grid examples in React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/install).

You can find the hosted Storybook app here: http://tylerhawkins.info/tables-and-grids/storybook-dist

## Running the App Locally

You can run the app locally by simply cloning the repo, running `yarn install`, and then running `yarn start`. This will start the Storybook app and open it in your browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `build`: Builds the Storybook app
- `eject`: Ejects the app from using react-scripts
- `format`: Formats the code using Prettier
- `format-watch`: Formats the code using Prettier in watch mode
- `start`: Starts the Storybook app in development mode
- `test`: Runs the tests in watch mode
